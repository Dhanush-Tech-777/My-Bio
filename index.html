            <h2>My Journey</h2>
            <p>From a young age, I’ve been fascinated by technology and problem-solving. My journey toward becoming a software engineer began during diploma final year project. As I delved deeper into the world of programming, I realized that software development was not just a passion but a path I wanted to pursue professionally.
              I graduated with a degree in B.Tech from Excel Engineering College, where I gained a strong foundation in Information Technology. My academic journey helped me build proficiency in programming languages like Java, MySQL, Android Development and FullStack and equipped me with the tools to tackle real-world challenges.
              During my time as a student, I had the opportunity to work on projects such as Blog World web development project, where I learned as teamwork, technical skills and practical application of concepts. These experiences solidified my desire to work in app development and web development.
              Though I’m just starting my career as a fresher, I’m excited to continue learning and contribute to the tech world. My goal is to work with talented professionals, grow my skills, and be part of innovative projects that make a positive impact.

          <h2>Notable Projects <br> learning Game application for PwDs Student</h2>
          <p>This project involved designing and developing an Android-based learning game for students with disabilities (PwDs). The goal was to create an interactive and inclusive educational game that helped students improve their skills in areas such as math, language, or cognitive exercises, while also addressing the unique needs of PwDs. The game incorporated several accessibility features such as:

            Voice Commands & Text-to-Speech (TTS): For visually impaired users, the game used TTS to read out questions and instructions.
            High-Contrast Mode & Larger Fonts: To support students with low vision, the game included high-contrast themes and customizable font sizes.
            Simplified Navigation: Touch gestures and larger touch targets were implemented for users with motor impairments, allowing for smoother interaction.
            Rewards System & Gamification: A points-based system with levels and feedback encouraged continued learning and engagement.<br><br>
            Technologies Used:
            
            Android Studio (Java/Kotlin)
            Firebase (for user progress tracking and data storage)
            Accessibility Tools in Android (TalkBack, Content Descriptions)
            Google Cloud Text-to-Speech API
            Material Design for Android<br><br>
            Challenges & Solutions:
            
            Accessibility Design: Ensuring the app was fully accessible required a thorough understanding of different disabilities and how they could impact game interaction. The solution was constant testing and collaboration with users to refine accessibility features.
            Performance Optimization: The game needed to run smoothly on low-end devices, so optimization techniques like memory management and efficient rendering were implemented.
            Outcome:
            The application was well-received during testing, with users noting its ease of use and educational value. The game successfully combined learning and fun, while offering accessibility features that made it usable for a wider audience of students.</p>
